      question: "What is the difference between a client and a server in networking?",
      answer: "A client is a device (like your computer or phone) that requests services or resources. A server is a computer that provides those services or resources. Think of it like a restaurant: you're the client ordering food, and the kitchen is the server preparing and delivering it."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use an old PC as a network server?",
      answer: "Yes! An old PC can work as a basic server for home use. It needs at least 4GB RAM, a reliable hard drive, and stable internet. However, consider power consumption and reliability - older hardware may be less efficient and more prone to failure."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need special software to run a server?",
      answer: "It depends on your needs. For basic file sharing, Windows or macOS built-in features work. For web servers, you'll need software like Apache or Nginx. Many use Linux distributions designed for servers, which are often free and more secure."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost to run a basic network server?",
      answer: "A basic home server costs ‚Ç¨200-500 for hardware plus ‚Ç¨20-50 monthly for electricity. Business servers range from ‚Ç¨2,000-10,000 initial cost plus ‚Ç¨200-800 monthly operating expenses depending on requirements."

              <p className="text-lg text-center">
                A network server is like a super-powered computer that provides services to other computers. 
                Think of it as the "helper" computer that stores files, runs websites, manages emails, 
                or handles other tasks for multiple users at once.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Network Server Explained Like You're 5</h2>
            
            <p className="text-lg mb-6">
              Imagine your office as a busy restaurant. Everyone needs different things: 
              some want food (files), others want drinks (internet access), and some need 
              the bill (email services). Instead of everyone running to the kitchen themselves, 
              there's a waiter (the server) who handles all these requests efficiently.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
              That's exactly what a network server does. It's a dedicated computer that "serves" 
              other computers by providing resources, storing data, or running applications that 
              multiple people can access simultaneously.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">How Does a Network Server Actually Work?</h3>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Here's the process broken down into simple steps:
            </p>

            <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-3">
              <li><strong>Your computer (client) makes a request:</strong> "I need the sales report file"</li>
              <li><strong>The request travels through your network</strong> to the server</li>
              <li><strong>The server processes your request:</strong> "Let me find that file"</li>
              <li><strong>The server sends back what you asked for:</strong> The sales report appears on your screen</li>
              <li><strong>Everyone else can do the same thing</strong> at the same time</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why Can't I Just Use My Regular Computer?</h3>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              You technically could, but it's like using a bicycle to deliver pizza to an entire city. 
              Regular computers aren't designed to handle multiple users, run 24/7, or store massive 
              amounts of data safely. Servers are built for reliability, performance, and security.
